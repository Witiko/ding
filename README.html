## Introduction ##

The ding library enables simple dispatchment of [storage events][].

  [Storage Events]: http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-event "Web Storage"

## API ##

### Method `ding.send` ###

Once called, the `ding.send` method will cause the dispatchment of a [storage event][storage events] in every other window / iframe sharing the dispatcher's domain and protocol. The method is invoked as follows:

    ding.send( name, value );

The method has no return value.

#### Attribute `name` ####

The `name` attribute contains a reference to a string representing the name of the dispatched storage event. The name should be a fully qualified domain name to prevent collisions.

#### Attribute `value` ####

The `value` attribute may contain a reference to a string representing the value dispatched with the event. If the `value` attribute is undefined, a pseudo-random hash obtained by executing `Math.random().toString(36).replace(/0\./, "")` is used instead.

The `ding.send` method supports the following overloads:

  1. `ding.send([ name1, name2, ..., nameN ])` is equal to calling `ding.send( name1 ); ding.send( name2 ); ... ding.send( nameN );`
  2. `ding.send({ name1: value1, ..., nameN: valueN })` is equal to calling `ding.send( name1, value1 ); ... ding.send( nameN, valueN );`

### Method `ding.listen` ###

Once called, the `ding.listen` method will add listeners for the specified incoming [storage event][storage events] in the current window. The method is invoked as follows:

    ding.send({
      "name1": callback1,
      "name2": callback2,
      ...
      "nameN": callbackN
    });

For every X from 1 through N, the `callbackX` method will be called, when a storage event with the `nameX` name is received. All names should be fully qualified domain names to prevent collisions. The method returns an unsubscription function, which will remove the listeners once invoked.

## Compatibility ##

Ding is compatible with any browser, which supports [ECMAScript 3+][ECMA-262 3rd edition] including the extensions described in the [WHATWG JavaScript specification][ECMAScript web extensions] and the Web Storage interface as described in [Web Storage W3C Recommendation][]. According to the [Mozzila development network][DOM Storage guide], the list includes:
  
 * Opera 10.50+
 * Mozilla/Firefox 3.5+
 * Internet Explorer 8+
 * Safari 4+
 * Chrome 4+

[ECMA-262 3rd edition]: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf "ECMAScript Language Specification"
[ECMAScript web extensions]: http://javascript.spec.whatwg.org/ "JavaScript, aka. Web ECMAScript"
[Web Storage W3C Recommendation]: http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/ "Web Storage"

## Compilation ##

### Assembly ###

The assembly of the ding source files requires a [POSIX.2][]-compliant environment. To begin the assembly, run the `make build` command in the uppermost folder of the project. At the end of the process, the `ding.js` file containing a static build of ding will be present in the `build` folder.

[POSIX.2]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/ "The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6"

### Minification ###

The minification of the ding source files requires the `closure-compiler` binary of the [Closure Compiler by Google][] to be executable and to reside within one of the directories in the `PATH` environment variable. To begin the minification, run the `make min` command in the uppermost folder of the project. At the end of the process, the `ding.min.js` file containing a static and minified build of ding will be present in the `build` folder.

The latest minified build of ding is also available online:

  * [`ding.min.js`](http://tiny.cc/ding)

Alternatively, you can use any other minification tool or service, as long as the license notice is kept intact.

## Unit testing ##

By loading the `src/test.html` file in your browser, you can run a suite of tests against the `src/ding.js` and `src/framework.js` files. You can use this to check, whether:

  * Ding is compatible with a given browser.
  * Your modified version of jBus works as intended.
